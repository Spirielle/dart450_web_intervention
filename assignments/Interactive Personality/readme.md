#Artist's Statement
My initial thought was "what is my online personality?" . After a while, I realized that my online self is pretty much divided in two: the professional "Cynthia" and the casual "Supi" , my nickname. Most of the activities I do online and social media websites I visit are usually exclusively related to either professional or casual me. Then, I tried to find a way to transform the classic "about" page most artists have on their personal website. It usually consist of an image, some text containing a bio or something and contact information. From the previous realisation that I have 2 online identity and one of them is more private/hidden, I thought it would be nice to have hidden content under the professional and perfection mask everyone is wearing.

Even though it required a lot of polishing, debugging and testing, it's a really simple page. Css wise, it makes the divs and their content stay at the same place without overflowing when the container is smaller than the content. This allowed me to make the top div resizable with JQuery and which makes a "before after" effect for the whole page. Every element has a static size based on the window\rquote s width. If the window is resized, everything is resized responsively. I thought the static size was required for the effect to work, but after some thoughts static margins and percentage width might have been enough. However I will keep it as it "just for the sake of it to prove I can use the technology".

##Choices Explanation
###Title
Cynthia is the name I use at university and work. For my friends, family and when I play online it's usually Supi. It's also a meme of mine to say "Supi Desu~~" which means "I'm Supi" in Japanese.

###Image
To have a nice visual effect I kept the same setup, but changed from professional to very casual.

###Text
For the context of this assignment, I believe the medium is more important than the message, therefore I simply used lorem ipsu to fill the gap. However, I still used cat lorem ipsum for the hidden content because it's more casual and silly.

###Link Logo
I decided to link all of my most used online accounts and divide them between what I want colleagues and outsiders to see and I want/allow my friends and family to see. To be honest, it makes me a little bit nervous to link all of them there, on the same page.
